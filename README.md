This is the **documentation** project repository for the [Penguin Statistics](https://penguin-stats.io/?utm_source=github) widget.

## Why another repo for docs?
This is to avoid any problems that I (yes that's me, GalvinGao, who makes lots of trouble >v<) may bring. Apart from that, in order to keep the widget frontend as small as it could, I can't or it's just too hard for me to keep two instances of `vue-i18n` and all that sorts of things into a single Vue project, so with that being said I've written the docs into a separated project. This is also to improve the maintainability of the docs since it seems to be overkilled to have a huge markdown within your packed widget frontend.
